/**
 * Functional utilities and abstractions for working with attributes.
 *
 * <p>This package contains small composable components used to query,
 * transform, and derive values from attributes. These utilities support
 * writing behaviour in a declarative style, where simulation logic can be
 * expressed in terms of attribute operations rather than bespoke field access.</p>
 *
 * <p>Components in this package are typically stateless and reusable, and may
 * be combined to build higher-level decision-making or update rules.</p>
