/**
 * Attribute-focused helpers for recording simulation results.
 *
 * <p>This package provides utilities for extracting, aggregating, and recording
 * attribute values as part of Modelarium’s results pipeline. It is intended to
 * bridge attribute-driven state representation with result collection, such as
 * snapshots, time series, or summary statistics.</p>
 *
 * <p>Where the core results API defines general-purpose result recording,
 * components in this package focus specifically on attributes as a convenient
 * unit of observation.</p>
