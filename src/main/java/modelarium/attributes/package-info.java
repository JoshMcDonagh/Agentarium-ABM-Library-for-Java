/**
 * Attribute abstractions for storing and accessing model state.
 *
 * <p>This package provides a flexible attribute system used to represent
 * dynamic state associated with agents, environments, and other model
 * elements. Attributes act as named, typed values that can be read and
 * modified during a simulation.</p>
 *
 * <p>The attribute system is designed to decouple state representation
 * from behaviour, allowing simulation logic to operate on attributes
 * without requiring rigid class hierarchies.</p>
 *
 * <p>Attributes may be used for purposes such as decision-making,
 * state transitions, logging, and result collection.</p>
